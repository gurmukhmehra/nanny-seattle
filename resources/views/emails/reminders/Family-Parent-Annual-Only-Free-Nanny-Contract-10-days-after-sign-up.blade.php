        <div class="section" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top:15px;">Hi {{$user_first_name}},</div>
        <p >It's been about 10 days since you signed up and I hope you have started to meet some of the AMAZING nannies and sitters in our community! If you are struggling to make connections, <a href="mailto:info@nannyparentconnection.com" style="color: #e58eb2;">don't hesitate to reach out</a> so that my team and I can help.</p>
        <p>I wanted to drop you a quick note to remind you that as a benefit of your Annual membership, you can download any of our nanny contracts for FREE!</p>
        <p >Let's face it. Contracts can be a pain to deal with. They can be complicated and you may find yourself feeling that you left something important out. That’s why we have worked with our attorney to create "easy to understand" <a href="{{URL::to('nanny-contract')}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #e58eb2;">nanny</a> and <a href="{{URL::to('nanny-share-contract')}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #e58eb2;">nanny share</a> contracts specific to Washington.</p>

        <h2>Everyone says their contract is the "best". Here's six reasons to check out ours:</h2>
        <p>#1: Our nanny contracts were developed by our attorney specifically with Washington state laws in mind. Do you live in the city of Seattle? Our contracts also include language specifically for parents hiring a nanny in Seattle.</p>
        <p>#2: A written agreement fosters open communications and clear expectations which are key to ensuring the relationship with your nanny goes smoothly. Unfortunately, most nanny contracts are filled with confusing legal jargon which many of us don't understand. All of our contracts are written in an "easy to understand" format which allows for a better understanding of the terms.</p>
        <p>#3: These days, it seems that federal, state and local laws are constantly changing. Our team is constantly monitoring changes to the law and updating our nanny contracts accordingly.</p>
        <p>#4: While there are many free "nanny contracts" available online, most <strong>do not include</strong> important laws and regulations such as Paid Sick Leave, Paid Family and Medical Leave, etc. that are required in Washington.</p>
        <p>#5: Our contracts include color coded instructions to make customizing the language a breeze.</p>
        <p>#6: After downloading your contract, you will have access to any updates that our team makes to the contract for as long as your membership remains active.</p>
        <p>BONUS: We've added a special COVID-19 safety section to all contracts to ensure that your family and nanny are safe!</p>
