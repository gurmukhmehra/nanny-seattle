				<strong>For Parents</strong>
				<p>The best option in the Puget Sound region for reaching thousands of care providers immediately is the Nanny Parent Connection. <router-link to="/sign-up-families-parents">As a member</router-link>, you can post a care opportunity “advertisement” and immediately begin hearing from providers who are interested in your opportunity.  Many nanny share relationships begin here as well! </p>

				<p>Currently the most effective resource for you to use to find care providers is our Facebook community.

				<p>In the journey of creating this website, it’s been interesting to learn that many of the large, national sites for hiring nannies and sitters have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">far fewer care provider members in the Puget Sound region than the Nanny Parent Connection!</span> Job postings there can be clunky to create and are only visible to those who find your listing in a search. My personal experience with several of these large, national sites was that I would reach out to many care providers but have few to none of them contact me back. Care providers likely aren’t checking those websites multiple times per day as they do with Facebook.  Some of these sites are expensive to use and can have confusing cancellation policies.  You don’t get to interact with other families in these groups and there is no sense of community. With these sites you look at a carefully curated profile made by the care provider, whereas with a Facebook profile you gain a more authentic and genuine idea of who a potential care provider really is.</p>

				<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>For Care Providers</b></span></h6>
				<br>
				<p>Many care providers have been using these online sites for years, and for some it works well.  I have heard numerous tales from care providers that “spammers” have become so prolific that they are now leery of using these sites or won’t use them at all.  I have also heard about retaliatory reviews made by parents on care providers’ profiles, and that these sites don’t provide quality support to care providers.  By having group interactions happen on Facebook, it lends transparency to the process by allowing you to check out a potential family’s member generated feedback – prior to responding to their post.</p>

				<h6><span class="s1"><b>For Parents</b></span></h6>
				<p>Craigslist is sort of the “wild west” when it comes to finding childcare. Yes, it is an option, but it is not regulated in any way. Anyone can create an ad and there is no screening process for users, accountability, or community input regarding the care provider. Most care providers are not checking Craigslist several times per day for new childcare wanted opportunities.</p>

				<h4 id="usingagency"><strong>Finding/Offering Child Care – Using an Agency</strong></h4><br>
				<h6><span class="s1"><b>For Parents</b></span></h6>
				<p>Working with an agency is the most expensive way of finding a nanny. It can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 to work with one of the larger agencies in Seattle. There are smaller, boutique agencies that cost less but they still charge several thousand dollars to find a care provider for you.  An agency can take the guesswork out of finding and screening a nanny (many agencies find their nannies here at the Nanny Parent Connection) and some parents want that.  Some agencies offer back up care for a healthy fee.  However, many parents can’t fit these premium prices into their budgets and would rather approach the search for and employment of a nanny with a little sweat equity.</p>

				<p>Agencies can have certain requirements of you for qualifications and they can decide which families you make contact with.  However, usually their services are of no cost to the nanny. Many agencies only work with a few families at a time so consider working with several agencies to ensure you find a job quickly.</p>

				<p>Once you have decided to hire a potential care provider, it is very important to conduct a comprehensive set of interviews. A phone interview is a good first screening tool for a potential provider.It is common to hold the second interview in the home where care will be provided, potentially with the children present to you can see how a provider interacts with them.</p>
				
				<strong>Tips from parents:</strong>

				<p>Found a provider candidate you want to hire? Congratulations!

				</div>

				<p>Connect with the provider on social media. Spend some time and review their Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc. profiles and make sure you are comfortable with what you are seeing. If you notice something that concerns you, talk to the provider! Don’t automatically drop the idea of working with them – there may be an explanation.</p>

				<p>Search the web. Spending a few minutes searching the provider (or parents’) name on Google or Bing can be important.

				<h4 id="backgroundcheck"><strong>Interviewing and Hiring – Background Checks</strong></h4>
				<p>Once you have decided to hire a care provider and they have accepted the job offer, it is very important to conduct a thorough background check. Background checks usually take a minimum of 2-3 days and should be completed once the job offer is accepted by the provider candidate.  The job offer, of course, would be contingent on the background check coming back clear. <strong><router-link to="/login">Login</router-link> or <router-link to="/sign-up-chooser">signup</router-link> to read more!</strong></p>
				
				<h6 style="padding-top:10px;"><b>Sources for conducting background checks:</b></h6>
				
				<p>I have spoken with dozens of parents and agency representatives over the past couple of years about nanny/sitter background checks. I consistently hear that there aren’t enough options available and that the options that are available are too expensive or too complicated.</p>
				
				<p>We set out to create a better solution! Our goals were to:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Create several background check packages that are affordable for everyone </li>

					<li>But not take away important aspects of the background checks in the name of affordability</li>

					<li>Have the background check order process not take more than five minutes</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Having a solid contract in place is crucial to setting things up for success with your provider.  It will help to outline clear expectations on both sides and can be an enormous help if situations that may otherwise become difficult to address come up later on.  Consider what is important to you as an employee at your place of work, or what benefits you wish you had that may be within your budget for your provider. This person will be caring for your most precious asset – your children!  It’s important that they feel fairly compensated and valued. </p>

				<p>Even with our extensive public transit systems, the reality is that your care provider may need to transport your children in a personal vehicle from time to time. Here are some tips to make sure that your children are safe:</p>
				<p>Make sure that the car your provider is using has appropriate child safety seats that are properly installed for each child who needs them.</p>
				<p>Review car seat installation with your provider. <a href="https://thecarseatlady.com/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for car seat guidelines.</p>
				<p>Go for a test drive with your provider.This can give you insight to what kind of a driver he/she may be. It can also give you the opportunity to show him/her around to locations he/she will be driving your child(ren) around to.</p>
				<p>Consider paying for your provider to take a defensive driving or advanced driver training course. These can be found by checking with your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or by calling your insurance agent.</p>
				<p>Consider starting out with only short trips to get comfortable with your provider driving your child(ren) around.</p>
				<p>Discuss and agree upon a ban on cell phone use while driving.</p>
				<p>Consider whether utilizing technology for monitoring driving habits is right for you and your provider. <a href="https://www.motosafety.com/" target="_blank">MOTOsafety</a> and <a href="https://www.life360.com/plans-pricing/" target="_blank">Life360</a> are two options for monitoring tools.

				<p>According to the IRS, yes, a person is an employee if you are telling them what they will do and how they will do it.  It doesn’t matter whether the work is full time or part time, or whether you pay the worker on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, or by the job. Since nannies or babysitters are told what to do with the children and how to do it (parenting styles, schedules, etc.), a child care worker is considered an employee as opposed to an independent contractor. That distinction is the difference between providing a W-2 or Form 1099 at year end and changes who is responsible for the employment taxes.</p>
